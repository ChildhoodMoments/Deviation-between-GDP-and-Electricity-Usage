In this paper, the author focuses on analyzing the deviation of GDP growth rate from the growth rate of electricity usage in Anhui Province, China (the author's hometown). Combined with the data of electricity consumption and total output value, the author sets up a regression model and uses the *Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index Method (LMDI)* method to analyze the reasons for the deviation from three perspectives: industrial structure, electricity consumption efficiency, and overall economic situation.
